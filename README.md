# Maintainiyf-Algorithm

V4 of the now-called Ad Astra project. With V1 being the GPT, V2 being the Transformer interface and V3 being just "Interface". I call it the model. It is semi functional. It does generate but it has struggles learning, I plan on taking the submodel class out and split into a singular file, abstracting the transformer implementations with the transfromer interface.

self documenting code baby, look at Main to see the interface itself. Tries to enfroce a 70-20-10 data split in train-val-test but fails
